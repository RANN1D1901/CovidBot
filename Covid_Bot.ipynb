By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[50]\n",

The WHO \"recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation… will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.\"[63][64] It was also noted that the WHO \"does not distinguish\" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.[65]\n",

            "The most important metric in assessing death rate is the infection fatality ratio (IFR),[74][c] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals infected (including all asymptomatic and undiagnosed) to-date.[76] In March, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).[77]\n",

            "\n",
            "In July, the CDC adopted the IFR as a \"more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19\" and computed an overall 'best estimate' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.[79][80] In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed ‘best estimate’ for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.[81][d]\n",

            "In September, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannides estimated global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%[e] overall and 0.05% for people < 70 years, much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic. Ioannides criticized prior \"average IFR … irresponsibly circulated widely in media and social media\" as \"probably extremely flawed as they depended on erroneous modeling assumptions, and/or focused only on selecting mostly studies from countries high death burden (that indeed have higher IFRs), and/or were done by inexperienced authors who used overtly wrong meta-analysis methods in a situation where there is extreme between-study heterogeneity.[87] As the data for his analysis was drawn \"predominantly from hard-hit epicenters\", Ioannides indicates that even lower \"average values of 0.15–0.25% … and 0.03–0.04% for <70 years) as of October 2020 are plausible.\"[87][88] He also notes that in European countries with a large numbers of cases and deaths[89] and in the U.S.,[90] \"many, and in many cases most, deaths occurred in nursing homes”.[91]\n",

Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards, including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.[12][13][14][15]\n",

            "SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[37] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[38][39] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-transmembrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET.[40]\n",

            "\n",
            "COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[41] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[42] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[43] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[44] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[45] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[46]\n",
            "\n",
            "SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the Central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[47][48][49]\n",
            "\n",
            "The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[50] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[51]\n",
            "\n",
            "The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[52] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[53] and is more frequent in severe disease.[54] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[52] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[52][55] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[56] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[57]\n",
            "\n",
            "Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[57] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[58]\n",
            "\n",

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.[405] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies.[406] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID-19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.[405] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.[403] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.[403] Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.[407]\n",

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.', 'The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020.', 'As of 6 November 2020, more than 48.6 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.23 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.', '[5]\\n\\n[b] primarily via [10] It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from COVID-19 mainly spreads through the air when people are near each other long enough,primarily via small droplets or aerosols , as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks.', 'Transmission via fomites (contaminated surfaces) has not been conclusively demonstrated.It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals.', 'People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases.', 'Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.', 'Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.', 'The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days.', '[11] There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials.', 'There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.', \"[12]\\n\\nRecommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, social distancing, wearing a face mask in public, ventilation and air-filtering, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic.\", 'Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.', 'Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.', 'The responses have caused global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.', '[13] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, famines affecting hundreds of millions of people, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.', 'Educational institutions have been partially or fully closed.', 'Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media.', 'There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.', '[14]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAlthough it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.', '[15] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the disease \"COVID-19\", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.', '[16][17] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[18] pangolin coronaviruses,[19][20] and SARS-CoV.', '[21] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.', '[22][23] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.', '[24]\\n\\nThe earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.', '[25][26] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.', '[27][28][29] There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.', '[30] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP) suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old person from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.', '[31][32] Phylogenic estimates in genetic studies conducted in early 2020 indicate that SARS-CoV-2 likely passed onto humans sometime between 6 October 2019 and 11 December 2019.', '[4]\\n\\nCases\\n\\nOfficial case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.', '[33][34] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.', '[35][36] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.', '[37] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.', '[38][39]\\n\\nOn 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.', '[40] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.', '[41][42] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.', '[43] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.', '[44]\\n\\nAnalysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.', '[45] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.', '[46] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.', '[47]\\n\\nInitial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[48] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).', '[49] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity.', 'By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.', '[50]\\n\\nEpidemic curve of daily new cases of COVID-19 (7 day rolling average) by continent\\n\\nSemi-log plot of weekly new cases of COVID-19 in the world and top five current countries (mean with deaths)\\n\\nCOVID-19 total cases per 100 000 population from selected countries [51]\\n\\nCOVID-19 active cases per 100 000 population from selected countries[51]\\n\\nDeaths\\n\\nOfficial deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols.', 'This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.', '[52] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.', '[53] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.', '[54][55] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.', '[56] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.', '[57] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[58] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.', '[59]\\n\\nMore than 95% of the people who contract COVID-19 recover.', 'Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.', '[60] As of 6 November 2020, more than 1.23 million[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.', 'People at the greatest risk from COVID-19 tend to be those with underlying conditions, such as a weakened immune system, serious heart or lung problems, severe obesity, or the elderly.', '[61]\\n\\nOn 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed the criteria for attributing deaths to COVID-19 to include those marked \"probable\"/\"likely.\"', 'The CDC said, \"It is not likely that [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] will follow up on these cases\" and that while the \"underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, … the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.', '\"[62]\\n\\nOn 16 April, the World Health Organisation (WHO) created two codes for classifying deaths: UO7.1, \"confirmed by laboratory testing irrespective of severity of clinical signs or symptoms\"; and UO7.2, \"diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available\".', 'The WHO \"recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation… will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as \\'probable\\' or \\'suspected\\'.', '\"[63][64] It was also noted that the WHO \"does not distinguish\" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.', '[65]\\n\\nMultiple measures are used to quantify mortality.', '[66] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[67][68][69] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.', '[70] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.', '[71]\\n\\nThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.', 'Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.5 percent (1,232,516 deaths for 48,625,084 cases) as of 6 November 2020.', '[5] The number varies by region.', '[72]\\n\\nSemi-log plot of weekly deaths due to COVID-19 in the world and top five current countries (mean with cases)\\n\\nCOVID-19 deaths per 100 000 population from selected countries[73]\\n\\nInfection fatality ratio (IFR)\\n\\nThe most important metric in assessing death rate is the infection fatality ratio (IFR),[74][c] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals infected (including all asymptomatic and undiagnosed) to-date.', '[76] In March, a peer-reviewed analysis of pre-serology data from mainland China yielded an overall IFR of 0.66% (with age-bracketed values ranging from 0.00161% for 0–9 years to 0.595% for 50–59 years to 7.8% for > 80 years).', '[77]\\n\\nIn April, an IFR range of 0.12–1.08% was derived from non-peer-reviewed serology surveys, with the upper bound characterized as much more credible and the range indicated as from 3 to 27 times deadlier than influenza (0.04%).', '[78]\\n\\nIn July, the CDC adopted the IFR as a \"more directly measurable parameter for disease severity for COVID-19\" and computed an overall \\'best estimate\\' for planning purposes for the U.S. of 0.65%.', '[79][80] In September, the CDC computed an age-bracketed ‘best estimate’ for the U.S. of 0.003% for 0–19 years; 0.02% for 20–49 years; 0.5% for 50–69 years; and 5.4% for 70+ years.', '[81][d]\\n\\nIn August, the WHO reported serology testing for three locations in Europe (with some data through 2 June) that showed IFR overall estimates converging at approximately 0.5-1%.', '[75] A systematic review article in The BMJ advised that \"caution is warranted … using serological tests for … epidemiological surveillance\" and called for higher quality studies assessing accuracy with reference to a standard of \"RT-PCR performed on at least two consecutive specimens, and, when feasible, includ[ing] viral cultures.', '\"[83][84] CEBM researchers have called for in-hospital \\'case definition\\' to record \"CT lung findings and associated blood tests\"[85] and for the WHO to produce a \"protocol to standardise the use and interpretation of PCR\" with continuous re-calibration.', '[86]\\n\\nIn September, a Bulletin of the World Health Organization article by John Ioannides estimated global IFR inferred from seroprevalence data at 0.23%[e] overall and 0.05% for people < 70 years, much lower than estimates made earlier in the pandemic.', 'Ioannides criticized prior \"average IFR … irresponsibly circulated widely in media and social media\" as \"probably extremely flawed as they depended on erroneous modeling assumptions, and/or focused only on selecting mostly studies from countries high death burden (that indeed have higher IFRs), and/or were done by inexperienced authors who used overtly wrong meta-analysis methods in a situation where there is extreme between-study heterogeneity.', '[87] As the data for his analysis was drawn \"predominantly from hard-hit epicenters\", Ioannides indicates that even lower \"average values of 0.15–0.25% … and 0.03–0.04% for <70 years) as of October 2020 are plausible.', '\"[87][88] He also notes that in European countries with a large numbers of cases and deaths[89] and in the U.S.,[90] \"many, and in many cases most, deaths occurred in nursing homes”.', '[91]\\n\\nOn 6 October, Dr. Mike Ryan, director of the WHO\\'s Health Emergencies Programme announced \"Our current best estimates tell us that about 10% of the global population may have been infected by this virus.', '\"[92] Also in October, the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) reported a \\'presumed estimate\\' of global IFR at between 0.10% to 0.35%, noting that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.', '[93] These researchers noted a decrease in IFR in England over time;[94][f] and, for the UK and Italy (the two Europeans nations worst hit by COVID-19), attribute the rise in daily cases, stability in daily deaths, and shift of cases to a younger population to waning viral circulation, misapplication of testing, and misinterpretation of test results rather than to prevention, treatment, or virus mutation.', '[95]\\n\\nCase fatality ratio (CFR)\\n\\nAnother metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio (CFR),[g] which is deaths attributed to disease divided by individuals diagnosed to-date.', 'This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on individuals with symptoms (and particularly on those manifesting more severe symptoms).', '[65] On 4 August, WHO indicated \"at this early stage of the pandemic, most estimates of fatality ratios have been based on cases detected through surveillance and calculated using crude methods, giving rise to widely variable estimates of CFR by country – from less than 0.1% to over 25%.', '\"[75]\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent).', 'Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.', '[102][103][104]\\n\\nAmong those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.', '[105] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.', '[104] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.', '[103]\\n\\nCause\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nDemonstration of a swab for COVID-19 testing\\n\\nCOVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.', '[118][119]\\n\\nOn 29 September, a letter in Lancet highlighted the increasing likelihood of overestimating of COVID-19 incidence as more asymptomatic people are included in RT-PCR testing with consequent \"misdirection of policies regarding lockdowns and school closures,\" noting that the false-positive rate in the UK is currently unknown, with \"preliminary estimates … somewhere between 0·8% and 4·0%\".', '[120][121] The letter called for \"stricter standards … in laboratory testing, … and pretest probability assessments … [including] symptoms, previous medical history of COVID-19 or presence of antibodies, any potential exposure to COVID-19, and likelihood of an alternative diagnosis.', '\"[122]\\n\\nViral testing\\n\\nThe standard test for presence of SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is

Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.', '[137] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.', '[136] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for

other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.', '[143]\\n\\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.', '[149][150]\\n\\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.', 'The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.', '[151][152] Some

social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.', '[155][156][157] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.', '[156][158] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing,

hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.\", 'This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.', '[175] In addition, soap and water disrupts the sticky bond between pathogens and human skin which causes the coronavirus pathogen to slide off the hands/body.', '[176] CDC has recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.', '[138] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes,

distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation.', 'Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression), and mitigation.', 'Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.', '[190] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading.', 'When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society.', 'A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.', '[191] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.', '[192]\\n\\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.', '[186] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.', '[186] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.', '[193]\\n\\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.', '[194] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.', 'South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.', 'Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.', 'Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised the hoarding of medical supplies.', '[195]\\n\\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.', 'Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.', 'Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.', 'Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.', \"[192]\\n\\nMandatory traveller information collection for use in

again on the rise in the world, with an estimated 690 million people already going hungry in 2019.', '[604] Based on the latest UN estimates, the economic recession triggered by the pandemic may lead to another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, going hungry in 2020.', '[604][605][606][607] This is mainly due to a lack of access to food – linked to falling incomes, lost remittances and, in some cases, a rise in food prices.', 'In countries that already suffer from high levels of acute food insecurity, it is no longer an issue of access to food alone, but increasingly also one of food production.', '[603][604]\\n\\nFamine\\n\\nThe pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production.', 'As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis \"of biblical proportions,\"[608] or \"hunger pandemic.', '\"[609] It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that \"12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger\" by the end of 2020.', '[610][608][611] This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019–20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.', '[612] 55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.', '[613] 265 million people are

'First identified in Wuhan, China, it is currently an ongoing pandemic.', 'Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.', '[6] Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.', '[10] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be precipitated by cytokine storms,[11] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.', 'Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards, including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.', '[12][13][14][15]\\n\\nCOVID-19 mainly spreads through the air when people are near each other long enough,[a] primarily via small droplets or aerosols, as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks.', 'Transmission via fomites (contaminated surfaces) has not been conclusively demonstrated.', '[19] It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals.', 'People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases.', 'The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.', 'Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.', 'The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.', 'There are no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19 yet, though several are in development.', 'Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.', 'Signs and symptoms\\n\\nSome symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent).', '[24][25] Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.', 'Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.', '[25] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.', 'As is common with infections, there is a delay, known as the [26] Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve.', '[26][27] As is common with infections, there is a delay, known as the incubation period , between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms.', 'The median incubation period for COVID-19 is four to five days.Most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all symptomatic people will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve.', 'Cause\\n\\nCOVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus strain.', 'Transmission\\n\\nVirology\\n\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.', 'It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.', '[34] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.', '[35]\\n\\nOutside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.', '[36]\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.', '[37] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin.', 'Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.', 'It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).', '[38][39] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S).', 'The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV.', 'In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-transmembrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET.', '[40]\\n\\nPathophysiology\\n\\nCOVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).', '[41] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.', '[42] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.', '[43] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[44] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.', '[45] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.', '[46]\\n\\nSARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the Central nervous system (CNS).', 'While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.', '[47][48][49]\\n\\nThe virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[50] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.', '[51]\\n\\nThe virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.', '[52] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[53] and is more frequent in severe disease.', '[54] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.', '[52] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.', '[52][55] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.', '[56] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.', 'Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.', '[57]\\n\\nAnother common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.', '[57] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.', '[58]\\n\\nAutopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.', '[59]\\n\\nImmunopathology\\n\\nAlthough SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.', 'Clinical laboratory findings of elevated IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP-1α), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) suggest an underlying immunopathology.', '[53]\\n\\nAdditionally, people with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have classical serum biomarkers of CRS, including elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.', '[60]\\n\\nSystemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart.', 'In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.', '[61] Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.', '[59]\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nThe WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.', '[63] The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).', '[64] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.', '[65][66] Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.', '[67][68] Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.', '[69] Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.', '[70][71][72] As of 4 April 2020 , antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.', \"[73][74][75] Antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start.\", '[76] The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.', '[77] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.', '[78] The absence or presence of COVID-19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough for an accurate diagnosis.', '[79] Different clinical scores were created based on symptoms, laboratory parameters and imaging to determine patients with probable SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe stages of COVID-19.', '[80][81]\\n\\nDiagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk.', 'These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.', '[82]\\n\\nA study asked hospitalised COVID-19 patients to cough into a sterile container, thus producing a saliva sample, and detected the virus in eleven of twelve patients using RT-PCR.', 'This technique has the potential of being quicker than a swab and involving less risk to health care workers (collection at home or in the car).', '[83]\\n\\nAlong with laboratory testing, chest CT scans may be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.', '[84] [85] Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.', '[84][86] Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.', '[84][87]\\n\\nIn late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.', '[88]\\n\\nCT

masks—pathogens can spread exponentially.This graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population.', '[93][94][95] Likewise, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity—called raising the line—such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand.', '[96] Progressively stronger mitigation efforts to reduce the number of active cases at any given time—\" flattening the curve \"—allows healthcare services to better manage the same volume of patients.Likewise, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity—called—such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, helps to meet increased demand.', '[94][97] Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration—such as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders—can allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation.', 'A COVID-19 vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest.', '[98] The US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.', '[99][100] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\".', '[94] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.', '[94][97]\\n\\nPreventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.', \"[101][102][103][104][105] Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.\", '[106][107]\\n\\nPersonal protective equipment\\n\\nFor health care professionals who may come into contact with COVID-19 positive bodily fluids, using personal protective coverings on exposed body parts improves protection from the virus.', '[108] Breathable personal protective equipment[clarification needed] improves user-satisfaction and may offer a similar level of protection from the virus.', '[108] In addition, adding tabs and other modifications to the protective equipment may reduce the risk of contamination during donning and doffing (putting on and taking off the equipment).', '[108] Implementing an evidence-based donning and doffing protocol such as a one-step glove and gown removal technique, giving oral instructions while donning and doffing, double gloving, and the use of glove disinfection may also improve protection for health care professionals.', '[108]\\n\\nFace masks\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and most government health agencies (such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the UK National Health Service (NHS), or the New Zealand Ministry of Health) recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.', '[109][110][111][112][113] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.', '[110][114] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.', '[110][114] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.', '[115][116][117][118]\\n\\nMasks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.', '[119]\\n\\nSocial distancing\\n\\nSocial distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons within large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.', '[120] Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 2 metres (6.6 ft) apart.', '[121] After the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate (\"R t \") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.', '[122]\\n\\nHand-washing and hygiene\\n\\nWhen not wearing a mask, the CDC, WHO, and NHS recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.', '[102][112][123] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.', \"[102][112] The WHO also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.\", '[123] The CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.', '[112] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.', 'In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.', 'Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis\".', 'Glycerol is added as a humectant.', '[124]\\n\\nSanitizing of frequently touched surfaces is also recommended or required by regulation for businesses and public facilities; the United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of products expected to be effective.', '[125]\\n\\nManagement\\n\\nPeople are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.', '[126][127][128] The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.', '[106] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.', '[129][needs update] Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.', '[130] Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.', \"[131]\\n\\nThe WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.\", '[99][132][133]

typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.', 'Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.', '[38] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being spent hospitalised.', 'However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.', '[142]\\n\\nAccording to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers,[143][144] air pollution is similarly associated with risk factors,[144] and pre-existing heart and lung diseases[145] and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of COVID-19.', '[144][146][147]\\n\\nIt is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.', '[148] One research that looked into the COVID-19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.', '[149]\\n\\nChildren make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10–19 years.', '[10] They are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults.', 'A European multinational study of hospitalized children published in The Lancet on 25 June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.', 'Four of those 582 children (0.7%) died, but the actual mortality rate could be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.', '[150]\\n\\nMortality rates are highly correlated to age.', 'In those younger than 50 years the risk of death is less than 0.5%, while in those older than 70 it is more than 8%.', '[151][152][153] According to a CDC analysis, the risk of death by age groups in the United States is 0.003%, 0.02%; 0.5% and 5.4% for the age groups 0–19, 20–49, 50–69, and 70 or over, respectively.', '[154][155]\\n\\nGenetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease.', 'For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID-19.', '[156][157] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.', '[158]\\n\\nPregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but data for COVID-19 is lacking.', '[159][160]\\n\\nComorbidities\\n\\nMost of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.', '[207] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.', '[208] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.', '[142] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).', 'Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC, are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis.', '[209] Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse patient outcomes.', '[210][211] When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID-19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.', '[212] COVID-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.', '[213]\\n\\nIn August 2020 the CDC issued caution that tuberculosis infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death.', \"The WHO recommended that patients with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID-19 couldn't rule out co-infections.\", 'Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases and 1.4 million TB related deaths by 2025.', '[214]\\n\\nComplications\\n\\nComplications may

may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.', '[223][224]\\n\\nLonger-term effects\\n\\nSome early studies [225][226] suggest between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.', 'A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.', '[227]\\n\\nOn 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros has warned that “to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects”.', 'He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as “really concerning.” They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects.', 'Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body.', 'Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms.', 'Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.', '[228]\\n\\nImmunity\\n\\nThe immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[229] just as with most other infections.', '[230] However, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.', '[needs update][231] Cases in which recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.', 'In some of these cases, the RNA from the first and second infections indicates a different strain of the virus.', '[232][233][234][235] Some reinfection cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[235] or false positives due to remaining, non-infectious RNA fragments.', '[236] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.', '[237]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,[35] through spillover infection.', '[238] The first known human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.', '[239][240][241] Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.', '[242] Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.', '[243][244] According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.', '[245] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but it was not the site of the initial outbreak.', '[246] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.', '[247]\\n\\nThere are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.', '[248] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.', 'There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were \"patient zero\".', 'By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.', '[137][249] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[250] and at least 266 by 31 December.', '[251] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals.', 'On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.', '[252] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.', '[253] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result.', 'That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\".', '[254] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[255] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.', '[256]\\n\\nThe Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[257][258][259]—enough to trigger an investigation.', '[260]\\n\\nDuring the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.', '[261] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.', '[38] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.', '[262] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[263] and more may have been infected.', '[264] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".', '[53][265] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.', '[264] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.', '[266]\\n\\nOn 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.', '[267] As of 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.', '[268] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths.', '[269] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.', '[270] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.', '[271] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[272][273] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.', '[274]\\n\\nOn 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case,[275] Beijing reported the first COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.', '[276] By 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.', '[277] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.', '[275][278]\\n\\nEpidemiology\\n\\nSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.', '[279] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.', '[280]\\n\\nThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.', 'Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.5% (1,232,516/48,625,084) as of 6 November 2020.', '[8] The number varies by region.', '[281]\\n\\nOther measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.', 'These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.', 'Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.', '[282]\\n\\nOutbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.', '[283][284] In the United States, the prisoner population is

from the disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (within a certain period of time).', 'The IFR, in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the infected individuals.', 'IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections.', 'In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.',

Studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe show IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.', '[293] According to the University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), random antibody testing in Germany suggested a national IFR of 0.4% (0.1% to 0.9%).', '[294][295][296]\\n\\nFirm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate.', 'As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.3% of the population).', '[297] May antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of 0.9%.', '[298] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of

significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.', '[303][304] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.', '[305] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.', '[306] In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.', '[307] As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.', '[308] Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and

COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.', '[389]\\n\\nIn September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.', '[390] The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).', '[390] The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).', '[390] The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 patients.', '[391][392]\\n\\nIn September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.', '[393] Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.', '[393]\\n\\nCytokine storm\\n\\nA cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.', \"Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.\", '[394][395] It is undergoing a Phase II non-randomised trial at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.', '[396][397] Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.', '[398] The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to undergo a Phase III clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on COVID-19 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.', '[399] To date,[when?]', 'there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.', 'Prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum IL-6 levels by saturating the IL-6R, driving IL-6 across the blood-brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of CRS.', '[400]\\n\\nLenzilumab, an anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for CAR T cell-induced CRS and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic GM-CSF secreting T-cells in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.', '[401]\\n\\nThe Feinstein Institute of Northwell Health announced in March a study on \"a human antibody that may prevent the activity\" of IL-6.', '[402]\\n\\nPassive antibodies\\n\\nTransferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.', '[403][404] The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.', '[404] This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.', '[403] Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.', 'The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies.', '[405] As of 8 August 2020, eight neutralizing antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have entered clinical studies.', '[406] It has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV might be useful for treating not only COVID-19 but also future SARS-related CoV infections.', '[405] Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.', '[403] Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.', '[403] Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.', '[407]\\n\\nLaminoid antibodies\\n\\nPeru announced in April 2020 that it would begin working towards creating a vaccine, with the pharmaceutical company Farvet and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) announcing plans to jointly develop a vaccine in Chincha.', \"[408] Peru's Experimental Station for Scientific Research and Genetic Improvement of Alpacas belonging to the Inca Group, selected on 5 June 2020 four alpacas for the development of a new vaccine that it had been developing in conjunction with Farvet and UPCH.\", 'They also indicated that alpacas have the ability to generate some types of antibodies known as \"nanobodies\", which are very small and have a greater potential to treat pathogens.', \"[409] According to Andina, research from the United States, Belgium, and Chile showed that antibodies from laminoid animals could possibly be formulated into inhaler or injection treatments for those infected with coronaviruses, with Teodosio Huanca of Peru's National Institute of Agricultural Innovation (INIA) National Camelid Program stating that Peruvian camelidae share the same genetic roots and antibodies.\", '[410]\\n\\nOn 7 August, the Peruvian National Institute of Health (INS) announced that it would begin the development of a possible treatment for COVID-19 using \"recombinant nanoantibodies\" from a llama named \"Tito\".', '[411] According to the INIA, Peru holds \"the only germplasm bank of South American camelids in the world, with 1,700 samples of alpacas and 1,200 of llamas\".', '[411]\\n\\nBCG vaccine\\n\\nResearchers have studied the BCG vaccine for potential non-specific protection against COVID-19 after observing that mortality and severity of disease has been lower in developing countries.', 'The WHO cautions that there are many factors that could impact these observations such as testing rate and disease burden.', '[412] In randomised controlled trials BCG has shown non-specific protection against other respiratory infections.', '[413]\\n\\nThere is currently not enough evidence to support a conclusion that BCG vaccine is effective to protect against COVID-19.', '[414] The University of Exeter announced the BRACE trial, a large international trial to study whether BCG vaccination reduces the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers.', '[415][416] A similar study was announced in the Netherlands.', '[413]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nCoronavirus diseases, a group of closely related
