The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 2 November 2020, more than 46.6 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 1.2 million deaths attributed to COVID-19.[5]\n",

Transmission via fomites (contaminated surfaces) has not been conclusively demonstrated.It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals. People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases.\n",

The incubation period is typically around five days but may range from one to 14 days.[11] There are several vaccine candidates in development, although none have completed clinical trials. There is no known specific antiviral medication, so primary treatment is currently symptomatic.[12]\n",

            "Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing, social distancing, wearing a face mask in public, ventilation and air-filtering, disinfecting surfaces, and monitoring and self-isolation for people exposed or symptomatic. Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of the infected.\n",
            "\n",
            "The responses have caused global social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression.[13] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of events, widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying, famines affecting hundreds of millions of people, and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. Educational institutions have been partially or fully closed. Misinformation has circulated through social media and mass media. There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[14]\n",

            "Although it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, several early infected people had visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.[15] On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) named the disease \"COVID-19\", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019.[16][17] The virus that caused the outbreak is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,[18] pangolin coronaviruses,[19][20] and SARS-CoV.[21] The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 has a natural origin.[22][23] The probable bat-to-human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional Chinese medicines.[24]\n",
            "\n",
            "The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[25][26] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[27][28][29] There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[30] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post (SCMP) suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old person from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[31][32] Phylogenic estimates in genetic studies conducted in early 2020 indicate that SARS-CoV-2 likely passed onto humans sometime between 6 October 2019 and 11 December 2019.[4]\n",

            "\n",
            "Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[34][35] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[36][37] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[38] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[39][40]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[41] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[42][43] Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies shown that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[44] Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[45]\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[46] It was not clear whether this was because young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[47] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected.[48]\n",
            "\n",
            "Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[49] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[50] R 0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[51]\n",

This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[53] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to over-counting.[54] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[55][56] This may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[57] The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[58] The first reported death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[59] and the first reported death outside Asia was in the United States on 6 February.[60]\n",

Otherwise, the time between symptoms onset and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[61] As of 2 November 2020, more than 1.2 million[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June, about 80% of deaths were recorded in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.[62] Individuals of any age with underlying health conditions are at increased risk of severe illness.[63]\n",

            "On 24 March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed criteria for attributing deaths to COVID-19 to include those marked \"probable\"/\"likely.\" The CDC said, \"It is not likely that [the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)] will follow up on these cases\" and that while the \"underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate, … the rules for coding and selection of the ... cause of death are expected to result in COVID–19 being the underlying cause more often than not.\"[64]\n",
            "\n",
            "On 16 April, the World Health Organisation (WHO) created two codes for classifying deaths: UO7.1, \"confirmed by laboratory testing irrespective of severity of clinical signs or symptoms\"; and UO7.2, \"diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically but laboratory testing is inconclusive or not available\". The WHO \"recognized that in many countries detail as to the laboratory confirmation… will not be reported [and] recommended, for mortality purposes only, to code COVID-19 provisionally to code U07.1 unless it is stated as 'probable' or 'suspected'.\"[65][66] It was also noted that the WHO \"does not distinguish\" between infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.[67]\n",

            "Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[68] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[69][70][71] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[72] Countries like Belgium include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[73]\n",

            "The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.6 percent (1,201,833 deaths for 46,618,804 cases) as of 2 November 2020.[5] The number varies by region.[74]\n",

Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards, including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.[13][14][15][16]\n",

            "SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[38] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[39][40] The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-transmembrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET.[41]\n",

            "\n",
            "COVID-19 can affect the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[42] The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.[43] The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.[44] The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective,[45] though another view is that increasing ACE2 using angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective.[46] As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.[47]\n",
            "\n",
            "SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brain stem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the Central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[48][49][50]\n",
            "\n",
            "The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[51] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[52]\n",
            "\n",
            "The virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[53] An acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China,[54] and is more frequent in severe disease.[55] Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.[53] ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[53][56] A high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[57] Blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high D-dimer levels) are thought to play a significant role in mortality, incidences of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events within the brain have been noted as complications leading to death in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infection appears to set off a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, constriction of blood vessels within the pulmonary circulation has also been posited as a mechanism in which oxygenation decreases alongside the presentation of viral pneumonia.[58]\n",
            "\n",
            "Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[58] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients both in China and in New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[59]\n",

He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as “really concerning.” They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.[231]\n",

In some of these cases, the RNA from the first and second infections indicates a different strain of the virus.[235][236][237][238] Some reinfection cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[238] or false positives due to remaining, non-infectious RNA fragments.[239] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[240]\n",

            "The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,[36] through spillover infection.[241] The first known human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.[242][243][244] Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.[245] Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.[246][247] According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[248] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[249] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.[250]\n",
            "\n",
            "There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[251] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province. There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were \"patient zero\". By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[138][252] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[253] and at least 266 by 31 December.[254] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[255] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[256] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\".[257] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[258] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[259]\n",

            "During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[264] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[39] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[265] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[266] and more may have been infected.[267] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".[54][268] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[267] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[269]\n",

            "Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent).   Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.   [282][332] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[333] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[334] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.\n",
